Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am a researcher, currently focussing on Reinforcement Learning and Stochastic Optimization. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the School of Industrial Engineering at Purdue University, working with Prof. Vaneet Aggarwal. Prior to this, I conducted my PhD research at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru under the guidance of Prof. Gugan Thoppe. My thesis has been submitted and is awaiting defense.
